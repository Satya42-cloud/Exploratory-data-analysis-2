# Exploratory-data-analysis-2
## Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, and Feature Selection on the "Adult" Dataset

### Objective
This assignment is designed to enhance your practical skills in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and feature selection. Using the "Adult" dataset, which predicts whether income exceeds $50K/year based on census data, you will apply and evaluate various techniques to build efficient machine learning models.

### Dataset
- Name: "Adult"
- Description: The dataset contains census information used to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K/year. It includes a mix of numerical and categorical 
  features.
  
### 1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
#### Data Exploration:
- Load the dataset and perform initial exploration, including generating summary statistics, identifying missing values, and understanding data types.
  Use Python libraries like pandas for exploration and visualization tools like matplotlib or seaborn for visual insights.
#### Handling Missing Values:
- Apply best practices for handling missing values, such as imputation or removal, depending on the nature and amount of missing data. Use techniques like mean, median, mode 
  imputation, or more sophisticated methods as appropriate.
#### Scaling Techniques:
- Standard Scaling: Transform numerical features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. Useful when the model assumptions require features to be centered and 
  scaled.
- Min-Max Scaling: Normalize features to a fixed range, typically [0, 1]. Useful when you need features to be within a specific range, which can be beneficial for algorithms 
  sensitive to feature magnitudes.
- Discussion: Provide scenarios where each scaling technique is preferred based on the model requirements and feature distributions.

### 2. Encoding Techniques
#### One-Hot Encoding:
- Apply to categorical variables with fewer than 5 categories. This technique creates binary columns for each category and avoids ordinal relationships between categories.
- Pros: Avoids unintended ordinal interpretation, suitable for categorical data with a limited number of levels.
- Cons: Can increase the dimensionality of the dataset, leading to the "curse of dimensionality."
#### Label Encoding:
- Apply to categorical variables with more than 5 categories. This method assigns a unique integer to each category.
- Pros: Simple and efficient for variables with many categories, reduces dimensionality.
- Cons: Implies an ordinal relationship between categories, which might not be appropriate.

## #3. Feature Engineering
#### Creating New Features:
- Generate at least two new features that could provide additional insights or improve model performance. For example:
- Interaction Features: Combine existing features to capture interactions (e.g., "hours_per_week * education_level").
- Binned Features: Create bins for numerical features to capture non-linear relationships (e.g., "age" binned into "young", "middle-aged", "old").
- Rationale: Explain why these new features might be useful based on domain knowledge and feature interactions.
#### Applying Transformations:
- Perform transformations on skewed numerical features (e.g., apply log transformation to features with skewed distributions). This can help in stabilizing variance and 
  making the feature distribution more normal.
- Justification: Discuss why the chosen transformation is appropriate for the feature and its impact on the model's performance.

### 4. Feature Selection
#### Isolation Forest for Outlier Detection:
- Use the Isolation Forest algorithm to detect and remove outliers. Discuss how outliers can distort model training and affect performance.
- Implementation: Apply the algorithm to identify and exclude outlier instances from the dataset.
  PPS (Predictive Power Score):
- Compute the PPS to evaluate the relationships between features and identify which features are most predictive of the target variable.
#### Comparison:
- Compare PPS findings with the correlation matrix to discuss similarities and differences in feature relationships.
- Discussion: Reflect on how the PPS provides additional insights beyond traditional correlation metrics and its impact on feature selection.
